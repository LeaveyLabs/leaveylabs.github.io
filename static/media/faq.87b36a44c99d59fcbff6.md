## the app

&nbsp;

### how does it work?

1 take the compatibility test. the test looks at your personality, interests, and values to see who you’d be a good fit with.

2 keep your phone in your pocket. your phone will automatically scan for your next match as you walk around and live your life.

3 get matched! when you walk nearby someone highly compatible with you, you’ll both get a notification and have 3 minutes to respond. if you both press “meet up”, your location will be temporarily shared with each other so you can find each other and say hi.

&nbsp;

### i signed up and took the test. now what?

just make sure your status is “active” and you’re good to go! live your life and let the app do the work in the background.

as you walk around, you might suddenly get a notification that someone highly compatible for you is around the corner. if you’re down, just press “meet up!”

&nbsp;

### please tell me there’s a cute notification sound that plays when i get matched?

omg how did you know

&nbsp;

### i just got matched with Jenny and want to meet up but i’m running late to class 😭

is love more important than grades? is she worth it?

that’s up for you to decide.

seriously though, we’d be happy to explain any tardiness to your Prof if you were busy connecting with someone through Leavey Labs. just hit us up at leaveylabs@gmail.com

&nbsp;

### oh my god, we both said “yes” to meeting up. now what!

this is where things get exciting!

you and your match will both have 5 minutes to find each other and say hi.

at any time, you can end the match and location sharing will stop.

&nbsp;

### i’m looking like shit today and don’t wanna be matched…

dw, we’ve been there.

if you don’t want to be matched with anyone for some time, you can always become inactive.

on the home screen, press the “active” button to toggle your status between active and inactive.

just make sure to turn your status back to “active” once you’re ready again ;)

&nbsp;

### you say we’ll get matched when we’re “nearby” each other—how nearby?

you’ll only be matched with people in walking distance—less than 500 feet away.

&nbsp;

### why do i need to enable location and notifications?

well, they’re both essential for the app to work.

your location is updated as you walk around so you can find out if you walk by someone who’s just for you.

notifications are necessary because you both only get 3 minutes to respond after you’ve been matched.

&nbsp;

### what happens with my location data btw?

we take privacy very seriously.

your test responses & location data is encrypted and only used to find your next match. all location data is deleted within 24 hours, and no data is shared under any circumstances. 

learn more in our **[privacy policy](scdatingclub.com/privacy)**.

&nbsp;

### will the app affect my phone’s battery life?

we use newly released Apple APIs to keep battery usage to a minimum. through our tests, we couldn’t detect any effect the app had on battery life. 

&nbsp;

### when **will it be available on Android?**

our app is powered by Apple’s new APIs. unfortunately, these are unavailable on Android, so we don’t have a release date at this time. 

sorry green text fam <3

## compatibility test

&nbsp;

### so what’s this compatibility test?

we use the power of human beauty and artifical intelligence to power a state of the art compatibilty test.

&nbsp;

### what are some examples of compatibility?

we find similarities in qualities (creative, minimalistic) interests (the outdoors, music), and more. We also match you with people in a similar age range to you.

&nbsp;

### how accurate are the matchings?

100% accurate.

&nbsp;

### right…
